# goal-keeper
simple goal-keeper game

Requirements:
Create a game, MPU sized  (300pixels x 250 pixels) where you play as a goalkeeper and have to defend 3 shots at goal.  

The banner has a title screen (PSD link here) which then clicks through to the actual game.  The title screen should be animated as you see fit. We recommend using a Tweening engine like GSAP.

For the game the ball is represented by a solid circle with a diameter of 20px.  The field colour is the hex value #a5bd7b.  The  goal area is represented by a black outline 200 pixels wide by 40 pixels high.  The goal is positioned at the bottom of the mpu and horizontally centred. The Goalkeeper  is represented by a rectangle (#666) 40 x 20 pixels.  The keeper can only move in the X axis and is positioned 10 pixels away from the goal area.

Itâ€™s up to you to think of any scoring elements and how the user will make the keeper move.  If you have time extend this simple game with any features you think would add to the experience.  

The game will be used in an AdWords banner and should be compatible with the Adwords specifications https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/176108?hl=en-GB
